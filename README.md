In some families there is tradition to draw a random person to prepare gift for.
Due to COVID-19, some of families cannot meet up and perform typical draw... and that's what this app is for.

Functionality:
1. Create a room (channel).
2. Set your name which will be displayed to others.
3. Copy a link of the channel and send it to friends/family (via Messenger etc.)
4. When there are minimum 3 people and everyone check Ready - the countdown will proceed.
5. After the countdown, every person will see his result. The result is shown only to individual person. The person cannot see results of other people.

...

6. If you don't trust this application and I am sure a lot of people would not... - after seeing the result you can VERIFY it.
7. Every person type ANONYMOUS message with name of the previously randomly selected person.
8. When everyone has typed a message, all of the messages will appear on the screen in random order.
